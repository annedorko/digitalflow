## You can avoid overwhelm.

I believe the web was built to help us do more, better.

But, despite all its potential for good, it has a way of getting the best of us instead of letting us do our best.

## It's time to make what matters.

You've got something great you're trying to do, but the technical sh\*t is dragging you down. Aren't you ready to find your flow doing the stuff that matters and **stop sweating the tech stuff?**

_Imagine it:_

Stop worrying about managing your website.

Stop trying to learn all the ins and outs of search engine optimization.

Stop researching domain and hosting costs.

Stop spinning your wheels on automation.

Sounds good, right?

## I can help you get a grip.

I've been connecting the dots between business ideas, websites, web services, and online marketing for about 15 years.

I know how to set up systems that work, and more importantly, that help _you_ work.

I know how to scrape data from one format and convert it into another.

I know how to drip content and deliver it to your audience in more ways than I can reasonably list.

I know how to design a simple, pleasing aesthetic.

I know how to write engaging content.

I know how to sync databases, logins, and connect things together that were never really meant to be connected together.

I know how to administrate web servers.

I know how to build and deploy static websites for free.

I know how to turn WordPress into a fully-fledged crowd-funded membership website powered by Stripe.

...I think you get the idea. I know how to do _a lot_, and I know how to do it well.

If you are running a business or a product and have found yourself in over your head and aren't even sure what you need, there's a good chance I can help you figure things out.

## Let's get started.
