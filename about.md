# Hi, Iâ€™m Anne Dorko.

I love making systems and starting projects.

## A bit about me.

I grew up in Southern California immersed in art and sunshine. I graduated with an A.A. in Graphic Design and my B.S. in Media Arts as a bright-eyed 18-year-old.

Right as my career was starting, the economic crash of 2008 struck hard. After several layoffs, I found myself freelancing web design, development, marketing, and SEO out of my car while traveling the 48 contiguous states in one big roadtrip.

Soon after, I lived in Austin for about a year. While there, I continued freelancing and tried my hand at car sales, brand ambassadorship, and a slew of other gigs that caught my attention.

Then, I took off around the world as an informal assistant photographer and travel companion for a fine arts model. I focused on making art and writing music during this time.

During my time in New Zealand, I met someone from Germany I was interested in seeing again. After a solo bike tour from San Diego to Salt Lake City and a summer in the Grand Tetons serving tables to get away from it all, I took off for Germany that winter.

Ever since, I've been working full time as a freelance web designer, developer, and online marketer. Now, I'm less than one year away from graduating with a Masters in Business Administration.

When you hire me, you're not just getting the job done. My work is nuanced. I come with a wealth of experience in a broad range of skills. My obsession with living a life without regrets means that I am passionate about what I do and have a deep interest doing what I do extremely well. I experiment with my life and time so that you don't have to.

You might be surprised at just how much I have to offer you.

Believe me when I say, I'm easy to talk to and usually pretty fun to have a chat with. Let's talk about your project.

## My work philosophies.

- Communication solves most problems.
- Leave people (and projects) better than you found them.
- Only make what matters.
- Done is better than perfect.
- Iterate, always.
- Simple, but better.
