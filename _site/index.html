<p>I believe the web was built to help us do more, better.</p>

<p>But, despite all its potential for good, it has a way of getting the best of us instead of letting us do our best.</p>

<h2 id="its-time-to-make-what-matters">It’s time to make what matters.</h2>

<p>You’ve got something great you’re trying to do, but the technical sh*t is dragging you down. Aren’t you ready to find your flow doing the stuff that matters and <strong>stop sweating the tech stuff?</strong></p>

<p><em>Imagine it:</em></p>

<p>Stop worrying about managing your website.</p>

<p>Stop trying to learn all the ins and outs of search engine optimization.</p>

<p>Stop researching domain and hosting costs.</p>

<p>Stop spinning your wheels on automation.</p>

<p>Sounds good, right?</p>

<h2 id="i-can-help-you-get-a-grip">I can help you get a grip.</h2>

<p>I’ve been connecting the dots between business ideas, websites, web services, and online marketing for about 15 years.</p>

<p>I know how to set up systems that work, and more importantly, that help <em>you</em> work.</p>

<p>I know how to scrape data from one format and convert it into another.</p>

<p>I know how to drip content and deliver it to your audience in more ways than I can reasonably list.</p>

<p>I know how to design a simple, pleasing aesthetic.</p>

<p>I know how to write engaging content.</p>

<p>I know how to sync databases, logins, and connect things together that were never really meant to be connected together.</p>

<p>I know how to administrate web servers.</p>

<p>I know how to build and deploy static websites for free.</p>

<p>I know how to turn WordPress into a fully-fledged crowd-funded membership website powered by Stripe.</p>

<p>…I think you get the idea. I know how to do <em>a lot</em>, and I know how to do it well.</p>

<p>If you are running a business or a product and have found yourself in over your head and aren’t even sure what you need, there’s a good chance I can help you figure things out.</p>
